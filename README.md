What's this then?
--

A PHP >= 5.3.3 framework. (5.3.3? Yes, to run absolutely beautifully,
5.3.0 is not enough.) Built for speed and customization. No
silly plugins, no components required, no database structure
requirements, no mandatory naming conventions, **no overhead**.

See TODO.md for progress, development and issues.

See INSTALL.md for 'installation' steps.


How does it work and what does it do?
--

I suggest you try the example app. To do that, you must read
INSTALL.md.

If you're too lazy to read INSTALL.md or import a database, I
suggest you get the fuk outta here OR you can read the example
app code. Everything in there (it's not much) is important and
interesting. It explains what's possible and in what ways.
